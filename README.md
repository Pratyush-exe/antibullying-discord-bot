# Bullying-The-Bully (Bot)

We created a NLP based discord bot, that takes all the messages texted from the server it is added to and then runs analysis and predicts if the text is offensive or not. If it finds the text offensive then it deletes the text and messages the Administrator of the server to block the person that sent the message.

## How to use
[Click here to add Bot to your server.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=908627254387568670&permissions=8&scope=bot)

Give Administrator access and then it good to go.

When someone Texts something offensive, then Bot deleleted the message and creates a poll to ban the user. If the number of votes reaches the threashold, then the user that texted it, gets banned.
