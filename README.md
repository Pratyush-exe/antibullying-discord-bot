# Bullying-The-Bully (Bot)

We created a NLP based discord bot, that takes all the messages texted from the server it is added to and then runs analysis and predicts if the text is offensive or not. If it finds the text offensive then it deletes the text and messages the Administrator of the server to block the person that sent the message.
